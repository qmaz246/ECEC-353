/* Program illustrating how the ptrace system call can be used to intercept system calls.
 * This example intercepts the write() system call, and modifies the contents of the 
 * buffer that is to be printed out by the child. 
 *
 * Author: Naga Kandasamy
 * Date created: February 20, 2020
 * Date modified: March 6, 2020
 *
 * Compile as follows: gcc -o intercept_syscalls intercept_syscalls.c -std=99 -Wall 
 * Execute as follows: ./intercept_syscalls ./program-name 
 * 
 * The tracee program is in the same directory as your simple_strace program.
